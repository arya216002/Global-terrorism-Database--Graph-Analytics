# Global-terrorism-Database--Graph-Analytics

## Overview
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is a comprehensive dataset that records acts of terrorism worldwide. I analysed the GTD to identify the countries most affected by terrorism and to explore the network of relationships among these countries. Using network analysis, I measured various centrality measures, including degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality, to understand the importance of each country in the global terrorism network.

## About the dataset
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is a valuable dataset that contains information on terrorist incidents worldwide. This dataset provides detailed information on the perpetrators, targets, tactics, and outcomes of terrorist attacks, as well as the geographical and temporal distribution of these attacks. The GTD dataset presents a unique opportunity to apply centrality measures to gain insights into terrorist networks and their operations.
